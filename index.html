  <h2>Dr. Pepper Blues:</h2>
  <p>A limmerick dedicated to my diet Dr. Pepper addiction.</p>
  There once was a man named chester,<br>
  He was addicted to Dr. Pepper,<br>
  <span class="indented">He drank it with glee,</span><br>
  <span class="indented">From morning 'till three,</span><br>
  His trash bin couldn't be fuller!

  <h2>My personal interests:</h2>
  <p>My first interest is that I like to work on electronics. I spend a lot of my time creating 
   prototypes for IoT devices that I deploy around my house. For example, I created an alarm system
   for my house with network cameras and notifications that I can look at on my phone. I also like to 
   create FPV drones and fly them around. It's a lot of fun to work on electronics.</p>
  <p>My second major interest is reading. I love reading all sorts of books, partricularly sci-fi fantasy books.
   I like the Dune series books, as well as the Cosmere books by Brandon Sanderson. I also really enjoy non-fiction such as
   philosophy and psychology, or really any book where I can learn something new.</p>
  <p>Finally, I am very interested in Cybersecurity. Since I like to program, I like the idea of keeping those programs secure, which is what brought me to be interested in cybersecurity for networks, cryptography, and web security. I also love to explore cryptography and learn about different cryptography schemes, particularly the math behind them.
   I've been studying lately on post-quantum cryptography which is absolutely fascinating.</p>
